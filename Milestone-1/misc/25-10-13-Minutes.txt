Meeting Date: 25/10/2013
Meeting Location: Swansea University, Faraday Board Room

Present: Adam Barrell, Lewis Hancock, Chris Lewis, Thomas Milner, John Ashley

Discussed background of the White Rock team and the Swansea Historical Association.

Discussed the initial requirements of the project and what the team thought was achievable.

John was very keen on the inclusion of google maps.

Both teams were to use the same database structure as only one would be going on the server.

Both teams would have slightly differing requirements to be discussed at a later date based on the team members expertise.
