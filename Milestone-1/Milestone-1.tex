\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}
The purpose of this document is to explain in great detail the requirements and specifications for the White Rock Digital Trails application. This document was originally created to allow for the development team of Digital Trails and any interested parties within the White Rock organisation.

\subsection{Client Background}
\label{sec:client-background}
White Rock Trails is a recent initiative in the Swansea area to create self-guided digital trails in Swansea's former industrial areas of White Rock and Hafod. 

TODO: wait for reply from John.

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}
Digital Trails is a self-guided trail application which was initially created by students at Aberystwyth University before being handed to this team. The development team will be modifying the current code-base and implementing new features to improve the usability and functionality of the application.

These modifications include, but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Replace OpenStreetMap with Google Maps.
\item Improving the usability of the application.
\item Allow real-time collection of GPS waypoints.
\item Allow real-time collection of geotagged photographs and other media.
\item Expand compatibility to a wide range of android tablets.
\item Enable social-media interactions within the application.
\end{itemize}

The database which stores the trails will also be modified so it can be found remotely on the tablet and modified when a user wants to add or remove trails from their application.

The development team will also be creating a web portal to allow for the creation new trails. Any user with a registered account will be able to create and modify their own walks to share with the rest of the user-base.

\subsection{Term Definitions}

\subsection{Overview}
The latter sections of this document contains the project requirements, specifications, methodology to be used and any identified risks. To begin, the document looks at the team's structure during the project; this may be seen in section~\ref{sec:team-structure}. In section~\ref{sec:gen-desc}. the Digital Trails project is examined at a high level, providing an overview of the system and any constraints upon it. Section~\ref{sec:requirements} contains the requirements of the project whilst section~\ref{sec:specifications} details the specifications. In section~\ref{sec:methodologies} the project's methodology has been described, first examining possible methodologies before stating which one the team will follow. The project's risks have been identified and analysed in section~\ref{sec:risk-analysis}. A timetable for the project can be seen in section~\ref{sec:project-plan}. Finally, the initial work completed on the project is discussed in section~\ref{sec:initial-work}.

\section{Team Structure}
\label{sec:team-structure}
This section will outline our teams structure, detailing which member will be responsible for each aspect and how they will work together. 

\subsection{Roles and Responsibilities}
This project has two major parts, the Mobile App and the Website. This structure lends its self to division of the team into two development groups. The Mobile group will deal with the development and design of the Android App and the Web group will create the web portal and back-end web services. The groups will be organised like so;  
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Web Group} & \textbf{Mobile Group} \\
\hline
Thomas Milner & Lewis Hancock \\
Adam Barrell & Chris Lewis \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}%

The two groups will not work independently, instead they will be co-operating through out the design and development process to ensure that the mobile application and website meet the same requirements and design choices. 

On top of the team allocations each members of the project has been assigned an individual role:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Role} & \textbf{Member} \\
\hline
Project Overlord & Adam Barrell  \\\hline
HCI \& UX Tzar & Chris Lewis \\ \hline
Android Genie & Lewis Hancock \\\hline
Web Guru & Thomas Milner \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}%

These roles are designed around each members expertise and skills. The Project Overlord is responsible for the general overview and control of the project; scheduling meetings, organising work days, ensuring deadlines are met and liaising with the client (John at White Rock). The HCI \& UX Tzar is in charge of the design process. Their main role is to ensure good UX design through out the project (See section \ref{sec:terms} for definitions of UX and HCI.). The Android Genie will lead the android team and is responsible for the development of the android application. They should ensure the use of good design practices during the development. Finally the Web Guru is responsible for the web team and is in charge of developing the website. The Guru should again ensure the use of good design practices and that the website correctly interacts with the existing framework of the android application. 

\subsection{Communication Strategy}

Communication is an important part of any project. The team will be using several different mediums to communicate with each other, the client and with 3rd parties. The first important medium is Social Media. 

We will be making extensive use of Social media for group communication. This will mainly take place through the Facebook platform, using the Chat system and a private group. This will allow us to talk as a group at any opportunity and to share documents and news. It can be used by the Project Overlord to publish details of meetings and keep us update with important news from the Client and other important parties. 

The second medium is formal meetings. They will be held by the Project Overlord and will be used for decision making by the group as a whole and as part of out methodology to ensure work is on target. Meetings will be scheduled in advance and will generally be held once a week at the end of the current development cycle. Occasionally the Client will be invited to attend meetings, this will mainly occur when the project reaches critical milestones. 

Emails will be the another important communication strategy, they will mainly be used for communication with the client and other 3rd parties such as lecturers who cannot be reached via social media and are not generally accessible for face to face communication. 

Lastly, as the team generally see each other regularly out side of the project, face-to-face communication will commonly be used for less formal discussion between members.

\section{General Description}
\label{sec:gen-desc}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sec:product-perspective}
Digital Trails is both an Android application and a web service allowing for the creation, modification and exploration of self-guided digital trails. The application will be capable of running across a range of Android based tablets and is for the use of the general public.

\subsection{Project Overview}
\label{sec:project-overview}
TODO: Black-box input / output.
TODO: Data Flow Diagram.

\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{sec:product-functions}


\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{sec:user-characteristics}
The most common user of Digital Trails is going to be familiar with the Android operating system and enjoy walking. There is also a smaller user-base to be found within primary schools where the familiarity with Android may be lower.  

\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sec:constraints}
As this project has been undertaken as an MEng group project there are multiple teams developing similar applications. The White Rock team have requested that all teams use the same database, the structure of which is to be decided upon between the groups.

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\label{sec:assumptions-dependencies}
The assumptions of the project are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Development machines will be available.
\item An Android tablet will be provided for development by White Rock.
\item A server with suitable hardware shall be available for the web portal.
\item Users are available for participation in user studies.
\item Third party libraries have been fully tested.
\item The code-base the team has received from White Rock is of a high enough quality to continue development.
\item All associated costs with web hosting and Google APIs will be covered by White Rock.
\end{itemize}

The dependencies of the project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The GPS on the tablet is accurate enough to alert users when they are near an item of interest.
\item The GPS is accurate enough to provide directions on time.
\item The database structure is decided upon between teams early into development.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodologies}
The chosen methodology must be suited to a small team working closely with the client. As the application is to be used by a wide array of people with varying levels of technical competency regular, high quality feedback will be necessary to ensure a positive user experience. From this it can be seen that an agile development methodology is likely to be most appropriate. In section~\ref{sec:considered-methods} the range of methodologies considered can be seen. In section~\ref{sec:chosen-method} the chosen methodology can be seen.

\subsection{Considered Methodologies}
\label{sec:considered-methods}
\subsubsection{Spiral}
This section is a modified version of the work found in ``A RESTful Document Archival System''~\cite{restWeb}. The spiral methodology is a risk based system, which works iteratively towards a final working project. The process derives its name from the pattern with which its process follows. There are 4 basic activities which must occur in cycle loop of the spiral\ref{img:spiral}. These are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Consider all success-critical win conditions.
  \item Identify and evaluate alternative methods for meeting win conditions.
  \item Identify and resolve risks caused by the methods for meeting win conditions. 
  \item Obtain the approval of stakeholders and their commitment to the next cycle. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=2.5]{spiral.jpeg}
\label{img:spiral}
\caption{The spiral model \cite{spiral}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

By identifying risks at each cycle the model allows the developers to decide on the best approach for that cycle and minimise the chance of failure through correct mitigation of those risks. 

This model requires the use of iterative development techniques. This helps force developers to make improvements to previous implementations and requirements, but the exact nature of the iterations are down to interpretation based upon the risks of the project.

Over all spiral is provides a good way of minimising risks in a project but it also has its down sides. It is possible that it it could be executed as simple cycle of waterfall development, this is not the intended use of the the project and is rarely the correct thing to do for the given risks of a project. It could also create an overly complex development strategy which becomes confusing to the development team. This complexity is one of the main arguments against the Spiral model and is addressed by other more agile methods. 

\subsubsection{Prototyping}
The prototyping methodology attempts to improve the flaws found in traditional software development models in which the product is not tested to see if it meets requirements until the end of the project. The prototyping process has four steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify basic requirements.
\item Develop initial prototype.
\item Review.
\item Revise and Enhance the prototype.
\end{enumerate}

A prototype is in one of two dimensions:
\begin{description}
\item[Horizontal] A user interface prototype which provides a broad view of the system from a user interface perspective. 
\item[Vertical] A complete prototype of a single subsystem or function.
\end{description}

There are many types of prototyping:
\begin{description}
\item[Throwaway] The creation of a temporary prototype, which will be thrown away, used to demonstrate how requirements might look when implemented into the final system. This allows for quick feedback from the user. Once the requirements have been finalised via prototyping, a set of final requirements are written and development of the final product begins.
\item[Evolutionary] Entails the creation of a robust prototype which will be constantly improved. The prototype is the heart of the system upon which new features can be added. The philosophy behind this approach is that a product is never done, but ``always maturing as the usage environment changes''~\cite{spcPrototyping}.
\item[Incremental] Requirements are developed as separate prototypes before being combined as the final design.
\item[Extreme] Especially used in web development. It is not discussed here as it is not applicable to the majority of the project.
\end{description}

The key benefits of prototyping as a methodology are a reduction in time and costs as changes to the prototypes are cheap in comparison to attempting to change the end product. There is also an increase in involvement between the development team and the user, allowing for faster feedback which will lead to a product the customer is satisfied with.

The disadvantages involve insufficient analysis, where developers spend too much time focusing on limited prototypes to see the bigger picture of the final application, often seeing developers overlook better solutions. Developers may also become attached to a prototype, over-estimate the ease at which a prototype may be implemented and develop the prototype excessively instead of moving on to the next stage.

\subsubsection{Extreme Programming}
This section has been taken, verbatim, from ``FormulaVis: System Requirements Specification''~\cite{formulaVis}. Extreme Programming is an agile development model aimed at improving the software quality by ensuring a fast and efficient response to changing requirements.

This model advocates frequent releases, similar to sprints in the SCRUM model, which improve productivity and create checkpoints where requirements can be reviewed and adapted. Other elements include pair programming, code reviews and unit testing of all code. Features should not be developed, in this model, until they are needed.

Development cycles begin with a Planning Game, a meeting that occurs at the begin of each cycle. This is divided into two tasks, release planning which determines the requirements to be included in this cycle and when the cycle should end. This phase includes the customer. The second phase is the iteration planning phase, in this phase the requirements are translated into tasks and assigned to programmers. These are then completed before the end of the cycle.

During implementation programmers usually work in pairs and unit tests should be programmed first, then code made to ensure those unit tests pass. This initial code may be inelegant and should be optimised at a later date. If code does not pass the unit tests
then it may not be released. A diagram of the process can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:xp}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 140mm]{circles.jpg}
\caption{Extreme Programming Model~\cite{xpCircles}}
\label{fig:xp}
\end{figure}

Critics argue that this practice suffers from unstable requirements and a lack of documentation. The addition of a customer representative as part of the development team can also create feature creep, resulting in a project which runs out of time and
money. The customer representative can also become a point of stress for the team, or a single point of failure for the entire project. Change-control boards are created to prevent this, a sign that there can be conflicts in project objectives. Many more criticisms can be found in Extreme Programming Refactored~\cite{xpRefactored}.
