\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}
The purpose of this document is to explain in great detail the requirements and specifications for the White Rock Digital Trails application. This document was originally created to allow for the development team of Digital Trails and any interested parties within the White Rock organisation.

\subsection{Client Background}
\label{sec:client-background}
White Rock Trails~\cite{whiterock} is a recent initiative in the Swansea area to create self-guided digital trails in Swansea's former industrial areas of White Rock and Hafod. Connected Communities funding for the White Rock project was won by the Historical Association Swansea Branch. The project has begun to gain traction within the heritage site community, seeing interest from other cities in the United Kingdom such as Sheffield.

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}
Digital Trails is a self-guided trail application which was initially created by students at Aberystwyth University before being handed to this team. The development team will be modifying the current code-base and implementing new features to improve the usability and functionality of the application.
These modifications include, but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Replace OpenStreetMap with Google Maps.
\item Improving the usability of the application.
\item Allow real-time collection of GPS way points.
\item Allow real-time collection of geotagged photographs and other media.
\item Expand compatibility to a wide range of android tablets.
\item Enable social-media interactions within the application.
\end{itemize}
The database which stores the trails will also be modified so it can be found remotely on the tablet and modified when a user wants to add or remove trails from their application.

The development team will also be creating a web portal to allow for the creation new trails. Any user with a registered account will be able to create and modify their own walks to share with the rest of the user-base.

\subsection{Term Definitions}
\label{sec:terms}

\subsubsection{OpenStreetMap}

\subsection{Overview}
The latter sections of this document contains the project requirements, specifications, methodology to be used and any identified risks. To begin, the document looks at the team's structure during the project; this may be seen in section~\ref{sec:team-structure}. In section~\ref{sec:gen-desc}. the Digital Trails project is examined at a high level, providing an overview of the system and any constraints upon it. Section~\ref{sec:requirements} contains the requirements of the project whilst section~\ref{sec:specifications} details the specifications. In section~\ref{sec:methodologies} the project's methodology has been described, first examining possible methodologies before stating which one the team will follow. The project's risks have been identified and analysed in section~\ref{sec:risk-analysis}. A timetable for the project can be seen in section~\ref{sec:project-plan}. Finally, the initial work completed on the project is discussed in section~\ref{sec:initial-work}.

\section{Team Structure}
\label{sec:team-structure}
This section will outline our teams structure, detailing which member will be responsible for each aspect and how they will work together. 

\subsection{Roles and Responsibilities}
This project has two major parts, the mobile application and the website. This structure lends its self to division of the team into two development groups. The Mobile group will deal with the development and design of the Android application and the Web group will create the web portal and back-end web services. The groups will be organised like so:  
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Web Group} & \textbf{Mobile Group} \\
\hline
Thomas Milner & Lewis Hancock \\
Adam Barrell & Chris Lewis \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The two groups will not work independently, instead they will be co-operating through out the design and development process to ensure that the mobile application and website meet the same requirements and design choices. 

On top of the team allocations each members of the project has been assigned an individual role:

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Role} & \textbf{Member} \\
\hline
Project Overlord & Adam Barrell  \\\hline
HCI \& UX Tzar & Chris Lewis \\ \hline
Android Genie & Lewis Hancock \\\hline
Web Guru & Thomas Milner \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

These roles are designed around each members expertise and skills. The Project Overlord is responsible for the general overview and control of the project; scheduling meetings, organising work days, ensuring deadlines are met and liaising with the client (John at White Rock). The HCI \& UX Tzar is in charge of the design process. Their main role is to ensure good UX design through out the project (See section \ref{sec:terms} for definitions of UX and HCI.). The Android Genie will lead the android team and is responsible for the development of the android application. They should ensure the use of good design practices during the development. Finally the Web Guru is responsible for the web team and is in charge of developing the website. The Guru should again ensure the use of good design practices and that the website correctly interacts with the existing framework of the android application. 

\subsection{Communication Strategy}

Communication is an important part of any project. The team will be using several different mediums to communicate with each other, the client and with third parties. The first important medium is Social Media. 

We will be making extensive use of Social media for group communication. This will mainly take place through the Facebook platform, using the Chat system and a private group. This will allow us to talk as a group at any opportunity and to share documents and news. It can be used by the Project Overlord to publish details of meetings and keep us update with important news from the Client and other important parties. 

The second medium is formal meetings. They will be held by the Project Overlord and will be used for decision making by the group as a whole and as part of out methodology to ensure work is on target. Meetings will be scheduled in advance and will generally be held once a week at the end of the current development cycle. Occasionally the Client will be invited to attend meetings, this will mainly occur when the project reaches critical milestones. 

Emails will be the another important communication strategy, they will mainly be used for communication with the client and other 3rd parties such as lecturers who cannot be reached via social media and are not generally accessible for face to face communication. 

Lastly, as the team generally see each other regularly out side of the project, face-to-face communication will commonly be used for less formal discussion between members. 

\section{General Description}
\label{sec:gen-desc}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sec:product-perspective}
Digital Trails is an Android application  allowing for the creation, modification and exploration of self-guided digital trails. A web portal will also be available for the creation and modification of trails. A web service will be set up containing a database to synchronise locally created trails and those stored on the server. The application will be capable of running across a range of Android based tablets and is for the use of the general public.

\subsection{Product Overview}
\label{sec:product-overview}
An overview of the product functionality can be seen here in the form of Data Flow Diagrams, these provide a high level look at how the application should function. Figure~\ref{fig:walkDFD} represents the flow of data when the user is using the Android application to go on a trail.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{walkDFD.png}
\caption{Data Flow Diagram for Loading and Running Trails on the Application}
\label{fig:walkDFD}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:userLoginDFD} shows the flow of data when a user is attempting to login, create a new account or bypass account registration in the Android application.

\label{fig:createTrailDFD}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{sec:user-characteristics}

The team has identified multiple types of users for the system:
\begin{description}
\item[Keen Walkers:] The most obvious user. They will likely have some familiarity with the Android operating system as they are capable of installing the application and will be excited to explore trails of varying difficulties.
\item[Primary Schools:] These users are likely to be regular customers with different groups of children. They will be led by a qualified adult, thus reducing the need for the whole group to be well acquainted with the Android operating system.
\item[Heritage Site Admin:] The type of user who will be creating walks for other user to enjoy. The system must be intuitive and, where possible, complete the task of creating a walk in as short a time as possible to help this user.
\end{description}

For all users it is expected that they can read and understand English, they are familiar with the Android operating system and no further familiarity with computer technology shall be assumed.

\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sec:constraints}
As this project has been undertaken as an MEng group project there are multiple teams developing similar applications. The White Rock team have requested that all teams use the same database, the structure of which is to be decided upon between the groups.

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\label{sec:assumptions-dependencies}
The assumptions of the project are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Development machines will be available.
\item An Android tablet will be provided for development by White Rock.
\item A server with suitable hardware shall be available for the web portal.
\item Users are available for participation in user studies.
\item Third party libraries have been fully tested.
\item The code-base the team has received from White Rock is of a high enough quality to continue development.
\item All associated costs with web hosting and Google APIs will be covered by White Rock.
\end{itemize}
The dependencies of the project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The GPS on the tablet is accurate enough to alert users when they are near an item of interest.
\item The GPS is accurate enough to provide directions on time.
\item The database structure is decided upon between teams early into development.
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}

This section will define the requirements of the software that is to be produced.
Each requirement will be listed with a unique code to allow for easier identification.
These requirements are defined at the request of the client and serve as a binding contract for the delivery of the final product.
The final product must satisfy all requirements listed in this section to fulfil the requirements of the client.
Section \ref{sec:func-reqs} will define the functional requirements of the software, these are requirements that have a specific behaviour or function in the software. 
Section \ref{sec:non-func-reqs} defines the non-functional requirements which specify a criteria which is used to judge the operation of the software.
These can be based on properties such as efficiency, usability and security.
Finally, section \ref{sec:nice-to-have} defines a set of optional features which will be `nice to have'.
These features are not essential to the core functionality of the final product but will add value if they are implemented.
Therefore, these features will be developed if all functional and non-functional requirements have been satisfied and time permits.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodologies}
The chosen methodology must be suited to a small team working closely with the client. As the application is to be used by a wide array of people with varying levels of technical competency, regular, high quality feedback will be necessary to ensure a positive user experience. From this it can be seen that an agile development methodology is likely to be most appropriate. In section~\ref{sec:considered-methods} the range of methodologies considered can be seen. In section~\ref{sec:chosen-method} the chosen methodology can be seen.

\subsection{Considered Methodologies}
\label{sec:considered-methods}
\subsubsection{Spiral}
This section is a modified version of the work found in ``A RESTful Document Archival System''~\cite{restWeb}. The spiral methodology is a risk based system, which works iteratively towards a final working project. The process derives its name from the pattern with which its process follows. There are four basic activities which must occur in cycle loop of the spiral~\ref{fig:spiral}. These are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Consider all success-critical win conditions.
  \item Identify and evaluate alternative methods for meeting win conditions.
  \item Identify and resolve risks caused by the methods for meeting win conditions. 
  \item Obtain the approval of stakeholders and their commitment to the next cycle. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=2.5]{spiral.jpeg}
\label{fig:spiral}
\caption{The spiral model \cite{spiral}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

By identifying risks at each cycle the model allows the developers to decide on the best approach for that cycle and minimise the chance of failure through correct mitigation of those risks. 

This model requires the use of iterative development techniques, helping force developers to make improvements to previous implementations and requirements, but the exact nature of the iterations are down to interpretation based upon the risks of the project.

Overall the Spiral model, provides a good way of minimising risks in a project but it also has its down sides. It is possible that it could be executed as simple cycle of waterfall development, this is not the intended use of the project and is rarely the correct thing to do for the given risks of a project. It could also create an overly complex development strategy which becomes confusing to the development team. This complexity is one of the main arguments against the Spiral model and is addressed by other more agile methods. 

\subsubsection{Prototyping}
The prototyping methodology attempts to improve the flaws found in traditional software development models. In these models the product is not tested to see if it meets requirements until the end of the project. The prototyping process has four steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify basic requirements.
\item Develop initial prototype.
\item Review.
\item Revise and Enhance the prototype.
\end{enumerate}

A prototype is in one of two dimensions:

\item[Horizontal] A user interface prototype which provides a broad view of the system from a user interface perspective. 
\item[Vertical] A complete prototype of a single subsystem or function.
\end{description}

There are many types of prototyping:
\begin{description}
\item[Throwaway] The creation of a temporary prototype, which will be thrown away, used to demonstrate how requirements might look when implemented into the final system. This allows for quick feedback from the user. Once the requirements have been finalised via prototyping, a set of final requirements are written and development of the final product begins.
\item[Evolutionary] Entails the creation of a robust prototype which will be constantly improved. The prototype is the heart of the system upon which new features can be added. The philosophy behind this approach is that a product is never done, but ``always maturing as the usage environment changes''~\cite{spcPrototyping}.
\item[Incremental] Requirements are developed as separate prototypes before being combined as the final design.
\item[Extreme] Especially used in web development. It is not discussed here as it is not applicable to the majority of the project.
\end{description}

The key benefits of prototyping as a methodology are a reduction in time and costs as changes to the prototypes are cheap in comparison to attempting to change the end product. There is also an increase in involvement between the development team and the user, allowing for faster feedback which will lead to a product the customer is satisfied with.

The disadvantages involve insufficient analysis, where developers spend too much time focusing on limited prototypes to see the bigger picture of the final application, often seeing developers overlook better solutions. Developers may also become attached to a prototype, over-estimate the ease at which a prototype may be implemented and develop the prototype excessively instead of moving on to the next stage.

\subsubsection{Extreme Programming}
This section has been taken, verbatim, from ``FormulaVis: System Requirements Specification''~\cite{formulaVis}. Extreme Programming is an agile development model aimed at improving the software quality by ensuring a fast and efficient response to changing requirements.

This model advocates frequent releases, similar to sprints in the SCRUM model, which improve productivity and create checkpoints where requirements can be reviewed and adapted. Other elements include pair programming, code reviews and unit testing of all code. Features should not be developed, in this model, until they are needed.

Development cycles begin with a Planning Game, a meeting that occurs at the begin of each cycle. This is divided into two tasks, release planning which determines the requirements to be included in this cycle and when the cycle should end. This phase includes the customer. The second phase is the iteration planning phase, in this phase the requirements are translated into tasks and assigned to programmers. These are then completed before the end of the cycle.

During implementation programmers usually work in pairs and unit tests should be programmed first, then code made to ensure those unit tests pass. This initial code may be inelegant and should be optimised at a later date. If code does not pass the unit tests
then it may not be released. A diagram of the process can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:xp}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 140mm]{circles.jpg}
\caption{Extreme Programming Model~\cite{xpCircles}}
\label{fig:xp}
\end{figure}

Critics argue that this practice suffers from unstable requirements and a lack of documentation. The addition of a customer representative as part of the development team can also create feature creep, resulting in a project which runs out of time and
money. The customer representative can also become a point of stress for the team, or a single point of failure for the entire project. Change-control boards are created to prevent this, a sign that there can be conflicts in project objectives. Many more criticisms can be found in Extreme Programming Refactored~\cite{xpRefactored}.

\subsubsection{Crystal Clear}
Crystal clear is part of a family of methodologies known as Crystal. There are several key traits to the Crystal family, Firstly projects are categorised based no there criticality and size. There are four levels of criticality for a project:

\begin{itemize}
\item Comfort (C)
\item Discretionary Money (D)
\item Essential Money (E)
\item Life (L)
\end{itemize}

This combined with the maximum number of people to be involved in the project make up the project category. For example a C30 project is a Comfort-Critical project involving thirty (30) people. This rating is important as they put emphasis on communication, which is made more difficult with larger teams. As such the project category helps calculate how rigorous the approach needs to be. 

Each member of the crystal family has been given a colour which is assigned to a project category. Currently there are Clear, Yellow, Orange, Red, Maroon, Blue, and Violet versions of the crystal methodology. 

Clear is designed for projects with a rating of around C6 or D6, with other colours aimed at more complex projects (Such as Red for the E80, D80 and C80 categories). 

Each methodology follows a set of common traits:

\begin{itemize}
\item Follows the Agile principles. 
\item Iterative-Incremental process. 
\item Each increment is no longer than four months.
\item No support for life-critical systems.
\item No support for distributed teams. 
\item Stresses effective communication and information flow. 
\end{itemize}

Crystal Clear is targeted at C6 and D6 projects where there is only one development team. The team members should work in close proximity to each other to deliver usable software at least once every three months, though it is usually much more frequent. 

The process starts with Charting. Charting is the process of forming a team, analysing the feasibility of the project, adjusting the development methodology and making an initial plan. 

After charting comes the cyclic delivery. There is usefully two or more delivery cycles, each one taking from one week to three months. During a cycle the team should be refining the plan, implementing subsets of the requirements through program-test-integrate iterations. These sub-iterations are usually daily cycles. As the iteration comes to a close they should be delivering the integrated product to users and reviewing the development methodology and project plan.

After the cyclic delivery is complete the project is wrapped up, the product is deployed into the user environment and post-deployment reviews and reflections are undertaken. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 140mm]{clear.png}
\caption{The composition of iterations in Crystal Clear ~\cite{Cockburn}}
\label{fig:clear}
\end{figure}

Generally Crystal clear is seen as good iterative-incremental process powered by planning and reviewing. It allows for continuous integration and is flexible and configurable to a users needs. How ever it only has limited scalability and does not share a common process with other crystal methods. It is also limited by its unsuitability for highly critical and over-dependence on inter-human communication. It also depends on a more day to day and continuous development period, which would make it difficult to apply to our project. 

\subsubsection{Scrum}
Scrum is an iterative and incremental type of Agile software development that focuses on the ability of a team to work together to complete the project. It encourages co-location of all members of the team and verbal communication. 

One of the key aspects of scrum is its ability to recognise that the client may change their mind about what they need, called a requirements churn, and that unpredicted challenges are difficult to plan for and address in an traditional manor. Its because of this that scrum adopts an empirical approach. This means the team should accept that a problem cannot be fully understood or controlled and instead should focus on their ability to work quickly and respond to any newly emerging requirements. 

SCRUM defines three core roles to any team:

\begin{description}
\item[Product Owner] The product owner is the stakeholder and voice of the client. They are responsible for producing a valuable product and writing customer-centric items for the project backlog. This role is usually combined with the role of Project Manager, but should not be merged with the role of Scrum Master. 
\item[Development Team] The development team are responsible for delivering a working product (A Potentially Shippable Increment (PSI)) at the end of each sprint cycle. The team is usually between three and nine members who carry out the analysis, planning, development, testing, etcetera on the project. The team is usually self-organised.
\item[Scrum Master] The scrum master is in charge of ensuring the development team can complete a sprint quickly and without impediment from external influences. They enforce the rules of SCRUM, chair key meetings and challenge the team to improve. Unlike a traditional Project Manager the Scrum Master doesn't have to deal with the management of people, only ensure the project is progressing and following the Scrum rules. 
\end{description}

One of the key aspects of SCRUM are the sprint development iterations. A sprint is a basic development iteration and is often has a fixed length. The length is often set before the sprint begins and varies between one week and a month. Sprints begin with a Planning meeting where the tasks are identified and an estimation of the commitment to that sprint is made. They end with a  review and retrospective meeting where the progress made is reviewed and any possible lessons from the sprint are documents for later sprints. Each meeting has a time limit, varying from three hours to eight hours. At the end of each sprint the software should be fully integrated, tested and working. It should be in a 'Potentially Shippable' state. During a spring there are daily scrums which are short fifteen minute meetings for the whole team to discuss the previous days work and what should be done that day. 

There are several artefacts related to SCRUM, Firstly there is a Product backlog. The product backlog is a list of requirements for the project. They are organised by the order in which they should be implemented. These requirements are usually features, bugs, non-functional requirements, etc. It is an open list and editable by anyone, but the Product Owner is ultimately responsible for ordering the items. 

As well as the Product backlog there is a Sprint Backlog which details the work the development team must complete in the next sprint. This is created by picking items from the top of the product backlog until the development team feel they have enough work to fill the sprint. Each item is broken down into tasks, which developers can sign up to work on. The sign up processes encourages the developers to be involved in the project. Once a sprint backlog is committed only the team can add to it.

The sprint method ensure that the product is regularly updated and in a working state. This can drastically decrease the time till completion for a project. The review process at the end of each sprint works to improve further sprints and improve the project as it progresses. It is actively anticipating requirement changes and is able to adapt to changing circumstances quickly and easily. Most importantly the method seeks to keep the developers involved in the project and forces them to take an interest in all stages. However the potential regular changes to requirements can result in a hectic and complicated work schedule. The frequent meetings and reviews also require a large amount of time which could potentially be spent developing the product further. 

\subsection{Chosen Development Methodology}
\label{sec:chosen-method}

The methodology which has been chosen is Scrum. From the methodologies discussed in section~\ref{sec:considered-methods} the choices were narrowed down to either Crystal Clear or Scrum due to their user focused nature and ability to adapt to change. Scrum was decided upon as it is a methodology which the majority of the team are comfortable with, or have used before. The sprints will allow for the team to keep a structured work flow throughout the project and ensure that each requirement is designed, implemented and tested before another is begun. In table~\ref{tab:scrumRoles} the team roles can be seen.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Adam Barrell & Product Owner \\ \hline
Thomas Milner & Scrum Master \\ \hline
Chris Lewis & Development Team Member \\ \hline
Lewis Hancock & Development Team Member \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{SCRUM Roles}
\label{tab:scrumRoles}
\end{table}

As the project leader Adam Barrell is to be Product Owner, Thomas Milner offered to act as Scrum Master and chair Scrum meetings. The remaining positions are development team members, filled in by Lewis Hancock and Chris Lewis. 

For version control the team shall be using Git (defined in section~\ref{sec:terms}), to help keep track of our backlog and what is currently in development the team shall also be using a Scrum project management tool called Target Process. This tool allows us to enter our backlog and manipulate it many useful ways. 

The initial sprint backlog can be found in section~\ref{sec:project-plan}.

\subsection{Software Testing}
Software testing is an important part of the development life-cycle. It is carried out in order to detect software failure. Identifying failure allows us to discover and amend software defects. Therefore, testing techniques will be used throughout the software's development. This will ensure:- 
\begin{itemize}
\item The software does exactly what the customer requires and meets the agreed specification. 
\item High quality software is produced.
\item The number of software bugs is significantly reduced.
\end{itemize}

For this project, several testing techniques will be employed; Unit, Regression, Functionality and Acceptance testing.

\subsubsection{Unit Testing} 
The purpose of unit testing is to examine the inner-workings of a software program. An internal outlook on the system is used in order to create test cases to run against the system. Test cases are generally formulated to cover branches, statements and paths within a unit. The term unit refers to a method of a class and therefore, unit testing will be performed on all classes of the program. This will ensure that every method produces the correct output. If a test fails, it will be comparatively easy to locate the error and then amend the code. Unit testing will be applied to classes when they are deemed complete. Each method of the class will undergo testing, hopefully ensuring 100\% coverage of the code. If a class passes all unit tests then we can be confident that the class components are correct and reliable. Performing unit tests will ensure that the code produced is correct, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the functionality provided by the software is correct. To overcome this issue, it will be necessary to perform functionality tests.

\subsubsection{Black-box Testing}
Functionality testing is essential to this project as users are constantly pressing buttons (input) in order to receive results (output). It will be carried out using ``Black-box'' testing. The purpose of black-box testing is to prevent the test engineer from viewing the implementation of the software. As its name suggests, its sole interest is the functionality of the system and, therefore, the test engineer is restricted to what a potential user would see. This allows the tester to assess the behaviour of the input/output functionality.

As no code will be made visible, the tester will create test cases based on the functional requirements and specification. These test cases will determine whether the software works together in the correct manner rather than testing parts of the system as individual units. This will ensure that the system does exactly what it is intended to do. When a new interface view has been developed, functionality tests will be applied. This will typically occur towards the end of every sprint cycle and will ensure that the functionality of the software complies with the requirements set at the beginning of the project. Functionality testing will also be applied towards the end of the project to ensure the entire system works smoothly and in the correct manner. The only issue with black-box testing is the fact that it is difficult to locate where in the code errors occur. However, this issue is reduced as errors in the code should have already been identified through unit testing.

\subsubsection{Regression Testing}
The third type of software testing that will be used is regression testing. This method of testing is used in order to uncover new software bugs that may be created due to alterations or enhancements being made to the system and can also be used to track the quality of the software's output. The purpose of regression testing is to ensure these issues don't introduce new software faults. Regression testing helps identify whether or not a change in one area of the software will affect any other areas. Regression testing will be employed by running completed tests that were previously carried out. If the behaviour of the software changes or if previous faults re-emerge, then the code can be re-examined and corrected. 

\subsubsection{Acceptance Testing}
The fourth and final testing method to be used will be acceptance testing. The general approach is to conduct tests, ensuring the software meets the requirements and specifications set out by the client. For this project, acceptance testing will be carried out by providing the client with the software after every relatively important feature has been designed and implemented. This will ensure the client approves of the product throughout the project. If the client has any issues or concerns with parts of the software then adjustments can be easily made. Monthly meeting with other members of the White Rock Trails company will also mean further software approval can take place. Both acceptance procedures will certify that the product created meets the client's requirements and also to a high quality standard.

\section{Project Plan}
\label{sec:project-plan}

\subsection{Sprint Feature Backlogs}

The requirements were used to build a set of tasks required to develop each feature of the project. These tasks were added to the backlog in the online tool and organised by feature. These task will be assigned to sprints and represent all the work necessary to complete the project. 

\subsubsection{Database}

\subsection{Milestones}
\label{sec:plan-milestones}

This section will outline a timetable for the work to be completed on the formal documents of this project. Figure \ref{fig:milestones-table} shows three milestones which appear in bold font and define a set of deliverables which are to be submitted by the specified \emph{end date}. Tasks are time boxed and must be completed within the specified start and end dates if the project is to be delivered on time. Levels of indentation within the table represents that a deliverable is a child component of the higher level. For example, \emph{Design}, \emph{Testing}, \emph{User Manual}, \emph{Reflective Account} and \emph{Draft Review} are part of the \emph{Final Report} which is separate from the \emph{Project Poster} but are all deliverables for milestone 1. Milestone 1 has been planned with a higher granularity compared to milestones 2 and 3 due to the knowledge gained from the current state of development. Sections for milestones 2 and 3 cannot be planned in advance as details of future work are not fully known.

Figure \ref{fig:GanttChart} shows the timetable of milestones represented as a Gantt chart. This chart provides a clearer overview of the time boxes allocated to each task within each of the three milestones. Black directional arrows represent task dependencies whereby the task being pointed to cannot start unless all tasks pointing to it have been completed. Milestones are represented by red diamonds and tasks by rectangular blocks. Green blocks represent the review phases where the documents are reviewed prior to submission. Finally, the leftmost table shows rows of task names corresponding to each time box on the same row in the chart. The time box of each can be calculated by subtracting the \emph{end date} from the \emph{start date}.

\subsection{Software Development}
\label{sec:plan-software-dev}

This section presents the timetable that will be used for the development of the Digital Trails software. As in section \ref{sec:plan-milestones}, tasks are time boxed and given a start and end date for which they must be completed in for the project to deliver on time. However, due to the dynamic nature of sprints when using the Scrum methodology, the exact dates of each sprint cannot be defined and thus a Gantt chart cannot be generated. As the development team are using 1-2 week sprints based on the amount of work that needs to be done, an abstract time box is defined for each sprint activity. Sprints will run from the start date until the end date by which time the final software should be delivered.

Client meetings are included in this timetable because they are essential to the software development process. Important feedback is gained when the development team meets with the client to discuss and demonstrate progress. The initial three client meetings shown in Figure \ref{fig:software-dev-table} represent the sessions needed to confirm initial requirements with the client prior to development. This activity is then replaced by the \emph{client feedback} phase near the end of each sprint.

\section{Risk Analysis}
\label{sec:risk-analysis}

This section will explore the risks associated with this project. An overview of these risks is presented using a risk matrix diagram in section \ref{sec:risk-matrix}. Sections \ref{sec:tech-risks} and \ref{sec:personal-risks} discuss technical and personal risks respectively. This risk analysis will ensure project risks are foreseen and appropriate mitigation strategies are in place should any materialise.

Sections \ref{sec:tech-risks} and \ref{sec:personal-risks} analyse the technical and personal project risks respectively. Each risk is given a subjective likelihood and impact rating from the range 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest possible likelihood/impact and 10 is the highest likelihood/impact. An overall risk rating is also assigned by calculating the result of likelihood multiplied by impact. Risks are described on the basis of how they impact the project should they occur. Finally, a mitigation strategy is discussed which aims to reduce the likelihood of the risk occurring.

The likelihood and impact of each risk was calculated subjectively by all four members of the project team. Both sets of personal and technical risks were identified within two group meetings. Each team member assigned a likelihood and impact rating to each risk. This was completed without discussion to prevent bias or influence. The team proceeded to debate the ratings given to each risk and arrived at a final conclusion. Discrepancies were resolved through a group discussion whereby each member either defended or changed their assignments based on the opinions of others. Finally, an overall risk rating was assigned to each by multiplying the likelihood and impact values agreed by the team.

\subsection{Risk Matrix}
\label{sec:risk-matrix}

This section presents the risks associated with this project in a risk matrix diagram shown in figure \ref{fig:RiskMatrix}. The risk matrix provides an overview of project risks which allow for easy identification of risk severity. The most severe risks are shown in red and tend towards the top right of the matrix which indicates a high risk rating.

Risk \texttt{TECRSK4} is shown to be the most severe, therefore it poses the highest threat as it is highly likely to occur and will severely impact the project. Risk \texttt{TECRSK4}  addresses the possible limitations of GPS hardware in the target device, the Tesco Hudle. If the GPS hardware was found to be severely limited, this would greatly impact the project as the app's location tracking would not work correctly. In addition, the project is dependent on the suitability of the Tesco Hudl as it will be the likely device used by the target audience. Risks such as these will require careful monitoring throughout the project. 

Risks tending towards the bottom left shown in green, are rated with less severity and thus do not require as careful monitoring. \texttt{PERRSK12} for example has the lowest overall risk rating and is therefore the lowest threat to the project. This risk addresses the absence of code documentation when the source is transferred from the previous development team. This risk is relatively unlikely to occur as it is standard practice for programmers to document code as it is written. If the documentation were to be absent, it would also not require a lot of time to create. Therefore, this risk has a low overall risk rating as its impact and likelihood is low.

\subsection{Personal Risks}
\label{sec:personal-risks}

This section explores the personal risks associated with the project. These risks are associated with the human aspects of the project. Such risks include team member absence, feature creep, poor time management and external work. \\

\noindent\begin{tabular}{@{}p{3.5cm}p{3cm}p{2.5cm}p{3cm}@{}}
\textbf{Code:} PERRSK1 & \textbf{Likelihood:} 4 & \textbf{Impact:} 7 & \textbf{Rating:} 28 \\
\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Risk:} A member of the team is absent for a substantial amount of time and is therefore not able to contribute to project work. This will cause the work rate to slow and may impact the delivery dates set out in the project timetable.} \\
\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Mitigation:} Extra time will be allocated to complete project tasks so delivery dates are not severely impacted if one team member is absent. } \\
\end{tabular}

\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Risk:} New software features are continually requested by the client after the initial requirements have been agreed. Unforeseen features will need to be allocated development time thus delaying subsequent project tasks.} \\ 
\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Mitigation:} An initial set of requirements will be agreed with the client and serve as a contract. Extra feature requests will be developed if they do not impact subsequent tasks.} \\ 
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5 cm}

\noindent\begin{tabular}{@{}p{3.5cm}p{3cm}p{2.5cm}p{3cm}@{}}
\textbf{Code:} PERRSK3 & \textbf{Likelihood:} 5 & \textbf{Impact:} 9 & \textbf{Rating:} 45\\ 
\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Risk:} The client requests the change of a feature which has already been developed. If this is a large feature such as the maps engine, a large amount of time will be required to change it, thus delaying the project timetable.} \\
\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Mitigation:} Features will be prototyped and shown to the client prior to implementation. This will ensure the client agrees with the features at a user interface level.} \\

\section{Initial Work}
\label{sec:initial-work}
In this section meetings with the client and the initial Scrum meeting have been detailed. The use of interface wireframes is also discussed.
\subsection{Minutes of Meetings}
Three meetings took place with the client, minutes of these meetings can be seen in Appendix A. The team has also had an initial Scrum meeting to define our backlog, the results of which can be seen in section~\ref{sec:project-plan}. 
\subsection{User Interface Wireframes}
A set of wireframe designs were made to help solicit feedback from the client with visual cues, thus helping clarify the requirements, these can be seen in Appendix B.
