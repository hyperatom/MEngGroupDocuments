\section{Team Structure}
\label{sec:team-structure}
This section will outline our teams structure, detailing which member will be responsible for each aspect and how they will work together. 

\subsection{Roles and Responsibilities}
This project has two major parts, the Mobile App and the Website. This structure lends its self to division of the team into two development groups. The Mobile group will deal with the development and design of the Android App and the Web group will create the web portal and backend web services. The groups will be organised like so;  
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Web Group} & \textbf{Mobile Group} \\
\hline
Thomas Milner & Lewis Hancock \\
Adam Barrell & Chris Lewis \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}%

The two groups will not work independently, instead they will be co-operating through out the design and development process to ensure that the mobile app and website meet the same requirements and design choices. 

On top of the team allocations each members of the project has been assigned an individual role:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Role} & \textbf{Member} \\
\hline
Project Overlord & Adam Barrell  \\\hline
HCI \& UX Tzar & Chris Lewis \\ \hline
Android Genie & Lewis Hancock \\\hline
Web Guru & Thomas Milner \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}%

These roles are designed around each members expertise and skills. The Project Overlord is responsible for the general overview and control of the project; scheduling meetings, organising work days, ensuring deadlines are met and liaising with the client (John at White Rock). The HCI \& UX Tzar is in charge of the design process. Their main role is to ensure good UX design through out the project (See section \ref{sec:terms} for definitions of UX and HCI.). The Android Genie will lead the android team and is responsible for the development of the android application. They should ensure the use of good design practices during the development. Finally the Web Guru is responsible for the web team and is in charge of developing the website. The Guru should again ensure the use of good design practices and that the website correctly interacts with the existing framework of the android app. 

\subsection{Communication Strategy}

Communication is an important part of any project. The team will be using several different mediums to communicate with each other, the client and with 3rd parties. The first important medium is Social Media. 

We will be making extensive use of Social media for group communication. This will mainly take place through the Facebook platform, using the Chat system and a private group. This will allow us to talk as a group at any opportunity and to share documents and news. It can be used by the Project Overlord to publish details of meetings and keep us update with important news from the Client and other important parties. 

The second medium is formal meetings. They will be held by the Project Overlord and will be used for decision making by the group as a whole and as part of out methodology to ensure work is on target. Meetings will be scheduled in advance and will generally be held once a week at the end of the current development cycle. Occasionally the Client will be invited to attend meetings, this will mainly occur when the project reaches critical milestones. 

Emails will be the another important communication strategy, they will mainly be used for communication with the client and other 3rd parties such as lecturers who cannot be reached via social media and are not generally accessible for face to face communication. 

Lastly, as the team generally see each other regularly out side of the project, face-to-face communication will commonly be used for less formal discussion between members.

\subsection{Development Methodology}
\subsection{Alternative Methodologies}

\subsubsection{Spiral}

The spiral methodology is a risk based system, which works iteratively towards a final working project. The process derives its name from the pattern with which its process follows. There are 4 basic activities which must occur in each loop of the spiral\ref{img:spiral}. These are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Planning
  \item Risk Analysis
  \item Implementation
  \item Evaluation
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]

\label{img:spiral}
\caption{The spiral model \cite{spiral}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


This model helps to solve several of the issues present in the waterfall model. Primarily it repeats upon its self, to allow for iterative development and improvement to existing implementations and requirements. It also heavily relies on risk analysis which helps minimise risk throughout the project. One of the downfalls of this system is that it requires a complete product to be developed before it can be iterated through again to refine it. In this way it is better suited to large on-going projects which expect to have multiple versions.

\textbf{Code:} TECRSK5 & \textbf{Likelihood:} 2 & \textbf{Impact:} 10 & \textbf{Rating:} 20\\ 
\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Risk:} Data associated with project documents and source code becomes corrupt or lost and cannot be recovered. Extra work will be required to rewrite source code and documents which will severely delay the final delivery.} \\
\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Mitigation:} GIT (see terms) will be used as a version control system which will synchronise and back up source code to a remote GitHub (see terms) repository. This will ensure code is recoverable to a previous state if it becomes corrupted or lost on a single development computer.} \\
\end{tabular}

\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Risk:} The GPS hardware on the target tablet device is not strong enough to maintain a consistent satellite signal whilst moving. This will limit the accuracy of a user's current location whilst using a walk on the app.} \\
\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Mitigation:} The GPS hardware of the target device, the Tesco Hudle will be researched to ensure its capabilities are fully known. A GPS polling strategy will also be devised to ensure the app locates the user accurately, regardless of transportation.} \\

\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Risk:} New software features are continually requested by the client after the initial requirements have been agreed. Unforeseen features will need to be allocated development time thus delaying subsequent project tasks.} \\ 
\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Mitigation:} An initial set of requirements will be agreed with the client and serve as a contract. Extra feature requests will be developed if they do not impact subsequent tasks.} \\

\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Risk:} The client requests the change of a feature which has already been developed. If this is a large feature such as the maps engine, a large amount of time will be required to change it, thus delaying the project timetable.} \\
\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Mitigation:} Features will be prototyped and shown to the client prior to implementation. This will ensure the client agrees with the features at a user interface level.} \\

\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Risk:} The user interface design of the web portal or app is poor causing users to struggle when using basic functions.} \\
\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Mitigation:} The best practices of mobile interaction design will be adopted to ensure the app's user interface is intuitive. Neilson's design heuristics will also be applied to the web portal user interface to ensure it is also intuitive. } \\

\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Risk:} Major or minor software bugs are present in the app or web portal which inhibit the desired functionality. This will have a negative impact on the user experience and require extra development time to fix. } \\
\multicolumn{4}{@{}p{17cm}@{}}{\textbf{Mitigation:} Blackbox testing methods such as unit and regression testing will be used at the end of each sprint to ensure modules are free from bugs.
